Sometimes, there is a divergence between the two concepts making sustainability attempts to look fragile and lacking real dedication and prioritization.

Toyota decreased its dependence on imports and operational risk, thus reducing its economic hazards in the event of price rises.</li><li><strong><em>Compliance first, then competitive advantage</em></strong>: Compliance must be addressed first and foremost by businesses, which often involves laws on waste management, pollution, and energy efficiency as well as human rights and labor accountability. Recent reports show that investors are shying away from compliance hazards progressively. </li><li><strong><em>Reactive to proactive</em></strong>: As a result of a crisis, many of today’s leading sustainability businesses such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Telenor, IKEA, Siemens, and Nestlé have stepped up mainly. For instance, in locations like Indonesia throughout the 90s, Nike confronted boycotts and government anger for abusive labor practices but turned the tide around. It became a pioneer in the establishment of transparency in 2005 by releasing a full list of the factories with which it contracts and a comprehensive 108-page report revealing conditions and payment in its factories. It also recognized huge problems, especially in its factories in South Asia. These businesses have all created more proactive sustainability approaches by acknowledging the effect of sustainability in a crisis.</li></ul>\n",

      "open communication with all key stakeholders based on high levels of\n",
      "information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy as well as an openness to\n",
      "recognize faults and improve practices.</li></ul>\n",
      "<p>Sustainability -triple bottom line- can drive a company’s achievement beyond shareholder value creation by building <strong>corporate shared value at its core </strong>and help in addressing social &amp;environmental problems. Several investors today use ESG metrics to evaluate the ethical effect and sustainability practices of an organization. Investors are looking at variables like the carbon footprint of a company, water use, community development efforts, and diversity board before investing. Companies have started responding to investors by publishing their annual sustainability reports. Research indicates that businesses with elevated ESG scores have reduced debt and equity costs and that sustainability projects can contribute to improving economic efficiency while encouraging government assistance. It’s only a matter of time, the flow of sustainability nourishes businesses in achieving holistic development for the environment, people and its profits.</p>\n",

      "Telemedicine, the use of technology to diagnose and treat patients remotely, has been rising in recent years. With the advent of high-speed internet and improved video conferencing tools, healthcare providers are increasingly turning to telemedicine to provide care to patients in remote or underserved areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemedicine, using technology to provide healthcare services remotely, has recently gained popularity. With advancements in communication and medical technology, it has become increasingly possible for doctors and patients to connect and interact from anywhere in the world. This has led to the rise of telemedicine, which has the potential to revolutionize the way healthcare is delivered.#Telemedicine\n",
      "\n",
      "The increasing focus on preventative healthcare has also driven the rise of telemedicine. As more and more people become aware of the importance of staying healthy, they are looking for ways to prevent illness and maintain their health. Telemedicine allows people to monitor their health and get advice from healthcare providers without traveling to a clinic or hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved access tohealthcare: One of the biggest challenges in the healthcare industry is the unequal distribution of medical resources, with many remote and rural areas lacking access to quality care. Telemedicine can help bridge this gap by allowing patients in these underserved areas to connect with healthcare providers worldwide. This can give people access to specialized medical care that they would otherwise not be able to receive, improving their health and overall well-being.#Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "Greater convenience and flexibility: Telemedicine also offers a level ofconvenienceandflexibilitythat is impossible with traditional in-person medical visits. Patients can consult with their healthcare providers from the comfort of their own homes, saving time and money on travel. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who have mobility issues or who live in areas with limited access tomedical facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reduced healthcare costs: By enabling patients to receive care remotely, telemedicine can help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. This is because telemedicine visits are generally less expensive than in-person visits and can help prevent the need for more costly interventions, such as hospitalizations. As a result, telemedicine has the potential to make healthcare more affordable for patients and healthcare providers alike.#Costs\n",
      "\n",
      "Enhanced healthcare outcomes: Telemedicine can also improve patients’ quality of care. By allowing healthcare providers to access medical records and other important information remotely, telemedicine can help ensure that patients receive the most appropriate care for their needs. This can lead to better health outcomes and a higher quality of life for patients.#Enhanced\n",
      "\n",
      "More significantjob opportunitiesin the healthcare industry like healthcare sector, including for healthcare providers, support staff, and technology experts. This can provide a boost to localeconomiesand help to reduce unemployment.#Jobs\n",
      "\n",
      "Better carefor chronic conditions: Telemedicine can help patients with chronic conditions to manage their health more effectively, allowing them to receive regular check-ups and treatment without the need to travel long distances. This can improve the quality of life for these individuals and reduce the risk of complications from their conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased flexibility for patients and healthcare providers: Telemedicine allows patients and providers to schedule consultations at times convenient for them, improving the overall flexibility of the healthcare system. This can help to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased accessibility: Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible to people living in rural and remote areas, who may not have easy access to medical facilities. With telemedicine, patients can consult with doctors and specialists from their homes using their phones, computers, or other devices. This means that more people will be able to get the medical care they need, regardless of where they live.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reduced costs: One of the most significant benefits of telemedicine is that it can reduce healthcare costs. Patients can avoid the costs of travel, accommodation, and time off work associated with in-person visits to the doctor. Telemedicine can also help reduce the cost of medical procedures, as doctors can remotely monitor patients and provide care without needing hospitalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved health outcomes: By providing patients with access to medical care from the comfort of their own homes, telemedicine can help improve their health outcomes. For example, patients with chronic conditions can use telemedicine to manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. Telemedicine can also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, as patients can receive care without contacting other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased convenience: Telemedicine offers a more convenient option for patients who need medical care. With telemedicine, patients can schedule appointments and consult with doctors at a convenient time without having to take time off work or arrange transportation. This can be especially beneficial for people with busy schedules or mobility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemedicine, or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. In the next 20 years, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system, providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients, it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers, telemedicine can reduce the strain on already-overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040, it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape, with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high-speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past, the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor, making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However, with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools, telemedicine consultations are just as good as in-person visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine, patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead, they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas, where access to healthcare can be limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer, the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors, telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example, a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient’s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes, telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition, telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes, telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition, telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way in which telemedicine will impact people’s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely, telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors’ spending on administrative tasks, freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care.\n",
      "\n",
      "One major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology, it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing, remote monitoring, and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas; patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances, saving them time and money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, telemedicine’s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations, the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. Telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes, reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors, including the increasing use of technology in healthcare, the need for improved access to healthcare, and the growing trend of remote work. As these factors continue to evolve, likely, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. For example, telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions, and some patients may still need to see a doctor. Additionally, telemedicine may put some jobs at risk, such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.\n",

       "'Thebusiness of business is no longer to do just businessor increase the bottom line to maximize shareholder value. Rather, the concept\\nof business is moving towards a new dimension of sustainable business, thetriple bottom line.People, planet, and profitsare the core\\nideologies that are rooted in sustainable business. Sustainability is taken\\ninto account when companies want to create long-term value creation along with\\nstrategies that promote the longevity of the company. As corporate\\naccountability rises, expectations and need for transparency among stakeholders\\nincreases therefore companies have started to recognize the need to be\\nsustainable to stay alert and alive.Business\\nglobalization that has happened over the previous few decades has made some\\ncompanies more powerful than some national governments, making it easy for them\\nto exploit inexpensive labor, plunder natural resources, causing severe impacts\\nthrough pollution on the natural environment, human health, and biodiversity.\\nUnfortunately for them, their horrible past has been catching up with them like\\nin the case of child labor issues of IKEA & Nike, Rana Plaza accident in\\nBangladesh affecting Zara, H&M and other clothing brands, environment\\npollution by BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil etc. With the emergence of internet and\\nsocial media these practices can no longer be covered up and silenced, the\\nworld has become more educated and less tolerant and therefore with every\\nmisdemeanor that is committed brand equity takes a hit. The media is fast\\npicking up on cover-ups, half-truths, and bad corporate behavior and demanding\\naccountability and transparency from corporates. Therefore to survive, companies\\nare compelled to adopt sustainability and bring forth the rules for their\\nsuppliers as well.Many\\nof the irresponsible company practices and disasters that are witnessed in that\\nlast couple of decades were motivated solely by short-termism-the desire\\nfor instant gratification-and the appeal of short-term performance\\nincentives. For instance, deferred maintenance and slack leadership were to\\nblame for the 1984 leaks from the pesticide plant Union Carbide India Ltd in\\nBhopal. Estimates placed more than half a million casualties from the gas\\ndischarge of the plant. Finally, Union Carbide Corporation’s 1989 litigation\\npayout came out to today’s equivalent of nearly one billion US dollars. Another\\nexample where the company was forced to shut down operations was Coca Cola at\\nits Plachimada plant in Kerala. The local communities faced acute water\\nshortage after the commissioning of the plant and the company authorities\\nblatantly ignored the community woes. These businesses stated above didn’t\\nrespect stakeholder engagement which ultimately lead to their untimely demise.Today’s\\nissues cannot be solved without participation from all stakeholders, and\\ncompanies with influence should be the torchbearers of change. They need to\\nengage with regulators, communities, societies, suppliers, and NGOs for\\neffective and desired outcomes. Issues where engagement are required include\\npopulation growth; global middle-class growth; decline in ecosystems; water\\nscarcity; food safety; material resource security; higher global energy demand;\\nchanges in geographic patterns of energy consumption; and increasing climate\\nchange regulatory interventions.By actively pursuing the triple\\nbottom line, the essential possibilities available are:save expenses\\nby reducing environmental effects;motivate\\nemployees and decreased employee turnover;decrease risk\\nthrough engaging with stakeholders;create a\\nreputation by improving environmental effectiveness ;In order for companies to commit\\nto sustainability they should have the below objectives in place:Strategy alignment and sustainability:management should ensure alignment between the company’s strategy and its sustainability initiatives. Sometimes, there is a divergence between the two concepts making sustainability attempts to look fragile and lacking real dedication and prioritization. For example, Toyota is well known for hybrid engine development, but less so for decreasing its reliance on rare earth minerals. Toyota decreased its dependence on imports and operational risk, thus reducing its economic hazards in the event of price rises.Compliance first, then competitive advantage: Compliance must be addressed first and foremost by businesses, which often involves laws on waste management, pollution, and energy efficiency as well as human rights and labor accountability. Recent reports show that investors are shying away from compliance hazards progressively.Reactive to proactive: As a result of a crisis, many of today’s leading sustainability businesses such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Telenor, IKEA, Siemens, and Nestlé have stepped up mainly. For instance, in locations like Indonesia throughout the 90s, Nike confronted boycotts and government anger for abusive labor practices but turned the tide around. It became a pioneer in the establishment of transparency in 2005 by releasing a full list of the factories with which it contracts and a comprehensive 108-page report revealing conditions and payment in its factories. It also recognized huge problems, especially in its factories in South Asia. These businesses have all created more proactive sustainability approaches by acknowledging the effect of sustainability in a crisis.Quantify,\\nincluding the company situation:\\nall businesses are struggling to quantify their sustainability investment\\nreturns. This is a straightforward problem with respect to compliance.Transparency\\nis a precondition for assessing and enhancing sustainability practices. The only way for companies to achieve transparency is through\\nopen communication with all key stakeholders based on high levels of\\ninformation disclosure, clarity, and accuracy as well as an openness to\\nrecognize faults and improve practices.Sustainability -triple bottom line- can drive a company’s achievement beyond shareholder value creation by buildingcorporate shared value at its coreand help in addressing social &environmental problems. Several investors today use ESG metrics to evaluate the ethical effect and sustainability practices of an organization. Investors are looking at variables like the carbon footprint of a company, water use, community development efforts, and diversity board before investing. Companies have started responding to investors by publishing their annual sustainability reports. Research indicates that businesses with elevated ESG scores have reduced debt and equity costs and that sustainability projects can contribute to improving economic efficiency while encouraging government assistance. It’s only a matter of time, the flow of sustainability nourishes businesses in achieving holistic development for the environment, people and its profits.Blackcoffer Insights 12 |Sanjana Jose Varghese | IIM Lucknow\\n'"
